# Coworking Lifestyle
What are the benefits, drawbacks, and everything in between?

## First, what is Coworking?
Coworking or Shared space is when more than one company or group uses the same working environment to run their business. This is accomplished when there are multiple office spaces to be used, an open floor desk space, and reserved desk spaces.
These different spaces can be used by anyone who is a member or purchases a day pass. 

## What is it like working in a coworking space?
Working in a coworking space is great for those who want a quiet location with a reliable internet connection, unlimited coffee, and other perks.

The actual space is usually laid out with a common area where people can talk freely without bothering others who are working. Kitchen area with coffee, ice maker, sink, dishwasher, and in some locations, a beer or two.
